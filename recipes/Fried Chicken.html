    <p>
      I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy
      fried chicken. This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over
      the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 to 4 pounds) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place chicken pieces in a large bowl and cover with buttermilk. Cover
        bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large resealable plastic bag, combine flour, paprika, garlic
        powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Shake to
        mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken pieces from buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off.
        Place chicken pieces in the bag with the flour mixture, a few pieces at
        a time; seal bag and shake to coat. Place coated chicken pieces on a
        wire rack set over a baking sheet; let rest for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour enough oil into a deep heavy skillet or Dutch oven to come halfway
        up sides of pan; heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry chicken pieces in hot oil until golden brown and juices run clear,
        about 15 to 18 minutes, turning occasionally. Drain on paper towels
        before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
