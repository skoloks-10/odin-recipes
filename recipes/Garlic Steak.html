    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds skirt steak</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed or finely minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>tablespoons white wine vinegar, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 pounds frozen crinkle-cut French fries</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>1/2 red onion, diced</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut skirt steak into 4-inch long chunks and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Add garlic, salt, black pepper, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 1 tablespoon
        vegetable oil to a bowl and whisk to combine. Add steak and toss
        thoroughly until evenly coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator
        for 2 to 12 hours. For best results, toss steaks occasionally to ensure
        even marination.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before using, remove steak from marinade and use a spoon to scrape off
        any garlic from the surface. Place steaks and reserved garlic back in
        the refrigerator until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake French fries according to package directions on a foil-lined baking
        sheet. The entire bag can be baked at once on a single sheet pan, but
        about 10 extra minutes cooking time may be needed (once baked, fries can
        be reserved, and reheated in a 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). oven for
        10 minutes until hot and crisp).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to a pan, and set heat to high.
        Add diced peppers and onions, and cook, stirring, until onions start to
        take on some color and turn translucent, a few minutes. Remove from heat
        and transfer into a bowl. Stir in 1 tablespoon white vinegar. Reserve at
        room temperature until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the same pan back over medium-high heat, and melt 2 tablespoons
        butter. Transfer steaks into the pan, and cook about 4 minutes per side
        or until they reach your desired doneness. The heat can be turned down
        to medium once the meat starts to brown. When steaks are done, transfer
        onto a plate, and reduce the heat to low. Cover steaks loosely with
        foil, and set aside until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add reserved garlic to the pan, and cook, stirring, for about 30
        seconds, just to take off the raw edge. Transfer in 1 tablespoon butter
        and 1 pinch salt; stir until melted. Turn off heat; reserve in a warm
        spot until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        For cheese sauce, add cream, cayenne, and salt to a saucepan. Bring
        cream to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally so it
        doesn't boil over. Cook for 1 minute to reduce slightly. Add in grated
        Cheddar and pepper Jack cheeses, turn off the heat, and whisk until
        cheese melts and a smooth sauce forms. Turn off heat and reserve in a
        warm spot until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice steak chunks across the grain into thin strips. Stir any
        accumulated juices from the plate steaks were resting on into garlic
        butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, divide hot French fries into 4 bowls. Top with sliced steak,
        and spoon garlic butter over. To finish, top with cheese sauce, pepper
        onion mixture, and chopped Italian parsley.
